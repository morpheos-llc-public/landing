A new wave is building in tech—and it’s not just about AI doing more. It’s about proving why hiring humans still matters.  
  
Continuing the theme of sharing articles I've been discussing in IRL conversations recently, this recent HR Dive article reveals how tech CEOs are saying the quiet part out loud: “Show us why AI can’t do the job—or we won’t hire more people.”  
  
This signals something deeper: AI adoption is no longer optional. I’ve already heard rumblings that employee performance reviews at big tech firms are starting to factor in AI tool usage. Not using AI? That might soon be marked as a performance inefficiency—even if your output is good.  
  
We can all see the potential flaws in this mindset. But the trend is undeniable:  
➡️ Smaller teams  
➡️ Higher expectations  
➡️ AI as a force-multiplier—and a baseline requirement  
  
If you’re not actively learning how to integrate AI into your workflows, you may soon find yourself competing with those who are. This isn’t about hype anymore—it’s about surviving in leaner, faster orgs.  
  
If you’re navigating this shift—or trying to get ahead of it—I coach professionals and teams to leverage AI more efficiently as individuals and as teams. Let’s talk.
